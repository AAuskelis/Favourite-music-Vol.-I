		<p>I'm a male should you be wondering, born in Lithuania and currently living in Vilnius (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsqeNdFzvlQ" target="_blank">yeah, the G-Spot of Europe apparently</a>). As you might have already guessed, I love listening to some good music, nothing keeps me going through hard days of work like listening to my favourite tracks, I'm also a big Arnold Schwarzenegger movies buff (hence the profile picture).<br>
		 Currently I'm working on obtaining new skills in Web Development and build some project in order to build a portfolio. Should you wish to build some project together with me and to get to know each other than feel free to find me on Discord and GitHub.<br> 
		Hasta la vista, baby!</p>
